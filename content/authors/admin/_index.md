Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at IFSC-USP (São Carlos - Brazil), having performed a one-year internship at BIFI-UNIZAR (Zaragoza - Spain) from 2019 to 2020. With a master in Atomic Physics, my current research is devoted to the world of complex systems and, in particular, epidemics and other spreading phenomena.

Ph.D. supervisor: Prof. [Francisco Rodrigues](https://sites.icmc.usp.br/francisco/index.html)

Supervisor in Zaragoza:  Prof. [Yamir Moreno](http://cosnet.bifi.es/people/yamir-moreno/)
