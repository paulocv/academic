I am a postdoc at the School of Public Health of Indiana University Bloomington (USA). I have a Ph.D. in Physics, obtained in 2022 from University of São Paulo (Brazil), having performed a one-year internship at Zaragoza University (Spain) from 2019 to 2020. In my current research, I work with multiscale modeling of airborne diseases in human populations.
