I am a postdoc at Indiana University, USA. I hold a Ph.D. in Physics, obtained in 2022 from the University of São Paulo in Brazil. From 2019 to 2020, I completed a one-year internship at Zaragoza University in Spain. My current research focuses on computational epidemiology, specifically studying respiratory and vector-borne diseases through computational modeling.
